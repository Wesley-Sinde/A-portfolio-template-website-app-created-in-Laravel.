# laravel-portfolio-site

A portfolio template website app created in Laravel.

## Purpose

This is one of my favorite laravel and tailwind css portfolio templates since it stands out right away. Why go through the trouble of starting from the beginning if you don't have to?
With a ready-to-use site canvas, you'll get the same fantastic results!
And this is a great example of it.
You may first see a live demo, which will give you a better idea of how amazing it is. That's incredible!
The parallax effect, on scroll content loading, back to top button, and animated statistics are just a few of the things you'll enjoy. This is only a small sample of the many delights that make Glint so unique.
Laravel and would be a great project for me to show what I've learned. This is the alpha version and only the prayer request program. I will be refactoring and updating as time goes on. This is open
source and you may clone it and modify to your heart's content
